#Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based diabetes prediction model developed using Python. The aim of this project is to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on certain input features.

#Dataset
The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database which contains a collection of medical data of Pima Indians females, including features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin level, and more. The dataset consists of 768 samples with 8 input features and a target label indicating whether the person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

#Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the project:

Python 3.7 or above
pandas 1.2.4 or above
numpy 1.19.3 or above
scikit-learn 0.24.2 or above
matplotlib 3.3.4 or above
seaborn 0.11.1 or above
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip or conda package manager.
Run the diabetes_prediction.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment or any other Python IDE of your choice.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the diabetes prediction model.
Optionally, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data by modifying the code in the notebook.
#Model Evaluation
The project uses the KNN from scikit-learn to predict diabetes. 
#Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of around 78% on the test data, with a precision of 78%, recall of 91%, F1-score of 84%3. These results indicate that the model is able to predict diabetes with moderate accuracy.

#Conclusion
In this project, a machine learning-based diabetes prediction model was developed using Python. The model utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and achieves moderate accuracy in predicting diabetes. The project can be further improved by experimenting with different algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve better performance. The code and results can be found in the diabetes_prediction.ipynb notebook in this repository.
